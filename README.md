## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-ws.git
cd chess-ws
```

## Install dependencies

For backend:
```bash
cd backend1
npm install
```

For frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Start the backend server
```bash
cd backend1
npm run dev
```

##Run the frontend
```bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
```

## How It Works
Player A creates a new room (assigned by backend).

Player B joins using the room ID.

Both players’ boards stay in sync via WebSocket events.

The backend validates moves and broadcasts updates to both clients.

Game ends when a checkmate or draw condition is detected.
